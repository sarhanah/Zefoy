##

### What is Zefoy?
[**Zefoy**](https://github.com/RozhakXD/Zefoy) is a tool used to get views on Tiktok using the Termux application. This tool gets help from [zefoy.com](https://zefoy.com) to get views.

You can get 1,000-2,000 TikTok views in 5 minutes!

### Termux command?
First you must have the [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk) application to run this script and for how to use it can be seen on [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/shuxzee). Then you enter some basic commands below!
```
$ apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
$ pkg install git python-pip
$ pkg install tesseract
$ git clone https://github.com/Sarhanah/Zefoy
$ cd "Zefoy"
$ python -m pip install pytesseract
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Run.py
```

```
$ cd "$HOME/Zefoy" && git pul
$ python Run.py
```

### Tiktok video link requirements?
- Your TikTok account must not be locked or private and videos must be public.
- The link must be correct and taken in the TikTok application or website.
- Example of a correct link: **https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSNVTS1eE/** or **https://www.tiktok.com/@rozhak_official/video/7311522299532840198**.

### Error sending views?
- Maybe there is a problem with the Zefoy server or it is being updated.
- You entered the wrong TikTok video link.
- You can try the Zefoy website manually.
- You can use airplane mode if the error occurs repeatedly and check whether the zefoy website is working.

### Login failed?
- Tools is trying to bypass the captcha in Zefoy.
- Maybe the tool failed to bypass Cloudflare or Zefoy is undergoing maintenance.
- Zefoy's security is so tight that tools can't get past it!

### How many views did you get?
- TikTok views can drop to less than 1000 if the server is busy.
- You can also get more than 1000 TikTok views.
- You can get 1000 TikTok video views in 4-10 minutes.

### Why have TikTok views dropped drastically?
- Maybe TikTok detected suspicious activity from your account so the developer deleted views from your video.
- Bugs from Zefoy directly because this is an unofficial website.
- Maybe TikTok's security is high so they can detect the bots you use.

### When will the views arrive?
TikTok views will arrive on your video in less than 1 minute after successfully sending, but these may not come in or come in for more than 1 minute if the Zefoy website has problems!
